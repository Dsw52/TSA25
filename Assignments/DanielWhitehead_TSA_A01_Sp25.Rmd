## Directions

Before making any edits to this file, please rename it such that it includes your first and last name (e.g., "DanielWhitehead_TSA_A01_Sp25.Rmd")

Once you have this renamed file open in RStudio, the first thing you will do is replace "author:" on line 3 with your name. 
Then you will start working through the assignment by  **creating code and output** that answer each question. Be sure to use this assignment document. Your report should contain the answer to each question and any plots/tables you obtained (when applicable).

When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.  Submit this pdf using Sakai. 

## Questions

```{r}
getwd()

Q4. Copy and paste the link to your forked repository on Github. It should looks like this: "https://github.com/lmmlima/TSA_Sp25"
